*My Life
*An Autobiography by Kenny Richardson

**Education

I studied at University of South Carolina. At first I was unsure of what exactly I wanted to do with my life.  
I began as a Chemical Engineering student before quickly switching to Chemistry.  
After a couple difficult years I switched to Computer Science and truly enjoyed it.

My favorite animal are dogs.

My favorite color is green.
